QAI-QERRA open-source prototype — quantum-ethical hybrid AI safeguards
### Vector 10: Conscious Remorse Horizon (CRH)

- Breakthrough: Pre-emptive remorse projection using quantum-inspired branching of future "selves".
- Builds on Vector 9 (post-action remorse) for proactive avoidance of misalignment.
- Result: Perfect -1.00 score = maximum safe alignment (no projected remorse).
- Code: vector_10_crh.py
- Interpretation: Model prioritizes paths where future selves feel full human-flourishing alignment.
